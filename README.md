I'm a Machine Learning developer with a strong foundation in Data Science and a passion for building AI-driven solutions. My focus is on engineering automated ML pipelines to streamline workflows, enhance operational efficiency, and drive data-driven decisions.

🎓 I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science from Banaras Hindu University and a Bachelors in Computer Science from Delhi University.

🚀 What I'm All About

🤖 ML Engineering: I specialize in engineering and automating end-to-end machine learning workflows, from feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to model training and deployment.

🐍 Python Development: I develop and deploy scalable REST APIs using frameworks like Django, integrated with both SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.

💡 AI-Powered Solutions: I have a proven ability to integrate AI into existing systems, recently developing models for weather forecasting and an OCR/NLP-based application to classify product ingredients.

⚡ Performance Optimization: I enjoy diving deep into code and database interactions to reduce process bottlenecks. I successfully optimized API performance by 25% in a previous role.
